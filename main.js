        // is cataloged and is part of the valence. The higher the valence
        // the higher the chance you will give it attention
        // the brainstem will give it 100% valence when flight.fight.flop.flee comes into play
        // it is the first stop our incoming signals get
        // your brainstem basically says, let me evaluate the most significant bit of this incoming stream
        // and if I think it is significant, we have to react NOW
        // so the Most significant bit of an 8 bit unsigned number is called
        // in old computer terminology, a word. And we don't deal with words and more

        // becuase Darwin
        // essentially if the valence comes back higher than F, where F is 
        // your threshold for FEAR. If valence is higher for that emotion, then 
        // then you will react instantly. Rage, Fear, Horror, Anguish. Hurt. Betrayal.
        // these are the emotions that generate adrenaline or something like it
        // those things where we feel it viscerally
        // because the valence on those things is at maximum
        // and we get adrenaline and all sorts of other things

        // and using every cycle you have to process whether this TIGER WILL EAT YOU
        // or this car coming at you will kill you or your partner will kill you
        // we are programmed, by definition, to resist everything in the universe
        // in direct proportion. We match every sense's emotion and valence with 
        // emotion of equal and opposite valence. In fact, we bump the valence up just a bit
        // which is why we bite back so hard
        // and if the other person says, fuck your valence, here's my opposite of your valence
        // and I've turned it up
        // Ergo, war
        // If nothing stops it. And it will require an outside force
        // or for one of the parties to realize they've lost and stand down
        // even if they know they are right becuase the outcome could become
        // violent. 
        // Now. If you've experienced this type of emotion before. This kind of betrayal 
        // this kind of abuse. You won't make the same mistake again.
        // Becuase when your current senses are condensed into that 8 bit number, it pulls it
        // from your memory usign the 4-bit word as the index. 4 bits is easy. ITs 16. I suspect
        // gentle reader. I predict that we can find 16 basic emotions. Maybe 7 becuase we need a sign bit for the 
        // negative. The basic emotiosn I have are anxiety, anger, doubt, shame, guilt. 
        // That is 5. Perhaps the other 2 are handled by the brain stem? 
        // My theory says the brain only processes resistance.
        // when it compares current reality to memory, and memories are the signature emotions
        // we only remember things where we learned new emotions 
        // and since we remember only things where we learn new things
        // our memories are scattered. And if don't learn something new in
        //.a while we won't remember what we did
        // OK. So here is where you have to do a mania test.
